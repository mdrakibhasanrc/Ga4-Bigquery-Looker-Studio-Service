An e-commerce company, TrendStyle, specializes in selling fashion apparel and accessories online. Over the past year, they have experienced fluctuating sales, with a noticeable decline in conversion rates. To address these challenges, the company decided to leverage advanced analytics tools to gain deeper insights into customer behavior and optimize their marketing strategies.
